This repository contains data and replicable code for a paper that explains differences in job insecurity across occupations using a network-based approach. The project introduces occupational embeddedness, defined as the overlap between workers’ professional and personal social ties, and shows that occupations with stronger internal networks tend to offer greater job security to their members.
